<p>This map helps answer the question "from where" are we citing. This map was generated using
  bibliographic data pulled from the reference lists of all 2019 issues of TDR and Theatre Survey using
  the AnyStyle parser. Viewers can toggle between TDR (blue) and Theatre Survey (green) to
see relative trends in the publishing location of cited materials. For instance, one can easily see
TDR citations have a significantly  more international scope which might suggest that research published in TDR
likewise has a more international focus. Pins on the map are also color coded to
indicate the top three publishing locations for both journals. </p>

<p>There are a number of considerations here when using this information to draw any conclusions about either jouranl.
  Primarily, the location of the publisher does not necessarily indicate the country of origin of the scholar
   or institution responsible for the work cited so does not offer an expansive view of the geographic or cultural
   diversity of a particular journal's interests. A close investigation of the practices and intrests of
  the most cited publishing houses would yeild a more nuanced analysis of a jouranl's scholarly affinities. Similarly,
  given more time, the existing dataset which includes author name (found under the data files link) could be expanded by manually researching the geographic
  location and institutional affiliations of cited authors
