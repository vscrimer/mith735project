<p>These tables contain the parsed bibliographic information from all 2019 issues of TDR and Theatre Survey.
The bibliographic metadata was first extracted from PDFs of journal articles using AnyStyle-Parser in Ruby
<a href=https://github.com/inukshuk/anystyle)>https://github.com/inukshuk/anystyle</a>. AnyStyle creates a series of json files containing the parsed bibliographical
entries. Ed Summers at MITH develop customized tools using the Ruby Library
to help streamline the extraction and file conversion process <a href=https://github.com/edsu/citation-playground>https://github.com/edsu/citation-playground</a>.
We were then able to convert all the json files for one issue into a single CSV. </p>

<p>There were a number of irregularities with this data which we cleaned up manually. In particular, dates
  were not standarized across citations. For instance, citations from newspapers tended to use mm/dd/yy format
  while books only listed the year. This made it impossible to accurately sort citations by date, so we
  went through the dataset and standardized every entry to reflect only the year. In addition to irregularities in date,
  several special characers, including
  hyphens did not survive the conversion process, showing up in CSV files as "â€“. Where possible,
  these irregular characters were double checked against the original citation and manually replaced.
  </p>

  <p> Other irregularities in the data arose from inconsistent formatting in the citations.
    For instance, the citations in Theatre Survey are formatted as endnotes which means that while some
    bibliographic entries have standard formatting and contain only bibliographic information,
     others contain discursive notes from the author. These discursive endnotes
    tended to confuse the parser. Where possible, we have cross-checked irregularities against the original PDFs
    and manually corrected the entries. This is a time consuming process and remains a significant problem in workflow.
    While AnyStyle can be trained and customized to better recognize bibliographic entries in differently
    formatted documents, the training process (which involves preparing a training data set of marked up documents) would
    not likely help the parser to sort through randomly assorted footnotes and endnotes.
