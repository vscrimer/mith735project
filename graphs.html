<p>This graph helps to answer the question from "when" are we citing. For instance we can see
<font style="italics">Theatre Survey</font> has published more work that cites original sources
from the 1920s, suggesting that this publication perhaps has a greater interest in publishing researcher
in that time period. Our initial data set is currently too small to draw meaningful conclusion because a single
article with dozens of references to primary sources could easily skew the data at this point, but with
the hope is that trends will emerge as we are able to analyze more data.</p>
<p>This graph reflects data shared on this site under <a href="table1.html">Data Files</a></p>
