    “Writing in the Disciplines: Trends in Performance Studies Scholarship”

  <b>
<li> Research Topic </li>
  </b>
  <p>
First emerging in the 1980s,
Performance Studies is a relatively new discipline which is, in fact,
interdisciplinary or (some would say) post-disciplinary.
Because Performance Studies scholars come from varied academic
fields and draw from approaches in Theatre, Cultural Studies, Anthropology, History,
and Literary Criticism it is difficult to identify consistent writing
conventions within the field. This poses a challenge for educators who wish to
familiarize their students with genre and design strategies, for academics
seeking publication, and for journals that wish to engender a fair and productive
peer-review process.
</p>
<p>
It is not the intention or desire of the primary researchers to standardize or
codify a “right” or “wrong” way to write within the discipline of Performance Studies,
rather it is our hope to identify existing trends in published writing across the
field in order to identify lacunae or anomalies in our writing and publishing
practices and start critical conversations amongst stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
For the purposes of this project, we are most interested in the quantity,
frequency, and overlap of works cited in scholarly journal articles across the
discipline. While citation analysis can offer a misleading or shallow metric for
measuring the worth or quality of a scholarly article we chose citations as a
topic because, an overview of works cited has the widest-reaching potential to
reveal dominant theoretical strains, over or under emphasis on certain subjects or
time periods, absent voices, oversights, redundancies, and biases within our
scholarship. We are not attempting to measure the scholarly worth or value of a
specific article or set of articles but rather to spot potential patterns.

  Team
  </b>
    </li>
<p>
The primary researchers on this project are two doctoral candidates in
Performance Studies, Victoria Scrimer and Kelley Holley. Victoria and Kelley will
be the primary parties responsible for selecting and collecting data, organizing and
cleaning up data, analyzing and presenting data. We also recognize, however,
the need to consult with and include at least one other team member who can assist
with coding in the text analysis process.
</p>

<b>
Literature
</b>
</li>
<p>
While there are a number of guides for research methodologies in the
discipline including Baz Kershaw’s Research Methodologies in Theatre and
Performance Studies and Thomas Postlewait and Bruce McConachie’s Interpreting the Theatrical Past, we are not aware of any comprehensive guide to writing in the discipline. Most guides to writing for performance or theatre focus on techniques for writing play scripts or program notes rather than performance analyses. An in-depth literature review of existing resources for theatre and performance scholars provides a necessary context for this project. In addition to subject specific literature, scholarship on text analysis and, specifically, citation analysis will provide
direction. We have built in time early in the project to review and write up a
summary of relevant literature in the timeline below.

  <b>
  Research Question(s)
  </b>
  </li>

<ul>
<li>	On average, how many works are cited in a single, published article? What is the ratio of books to articles?</li>

<li> What are the most frequently cited books over the last ten years of performance studies scholarship? When were they published? </li>

<li> What are the most frequently cited articles or essays over the last ten years of performance studies scholarship? When were they published?</li>

<li> What are the most frequently cited performances or plays over the last ten years of performance studies scholarship?</li>
</ul>
<li>
<b>
Subject of Study
</b>
</li>
<p>
For our subject of study, we have identified four of the top journals in the field
of Performance Studies each of which represents a different professional organization
and approach to the discipline-Theatre Research, Theatre Journal, Performance Research
and The Drama Review (TDR). For the purposes of drawing comparisons between refereed
and non-refereed publications, three of these journals are peer-reviewed and one
(TDR) is not.
</p>
<p>
Because we are approaching the end of the second decade of the 21st century it seemed
timely to frame this project as a ten-year retrospective on Performance Studies
scholarship. This is both an appealing framework for possible publications as well
as a statistically significant span of time from which to draw conclusions.
</p>
<p>
We have chosen to focus only on featured articles in each of the four publications,
excluding book reviews, editorial notes, or issue introductions in order to mitigate
potential publication-based biases and text that might skew the data.
</p>

<b>
Methodology
</b>
</li>
<p>
Distant reading, or the collection and analysis of large quantities of text, has traditionally been used to analyze literary texts, but could easily be used to model the genre conventions of academic writing.

In order to engage in distant reading of Performance Studies scholarship, we will need to perform a text analysis of a large corpus of scholarly articles. For the purposes of this project we are specifically interested in performing a type of citation analysis.

In order to perform a text analysis we will need to collect and collate machine readable text of the research subject from each issue of each journal dating back ten years.

Based on the results of the text analysis we will design a comparative data visualization to help share and explain our findings.
