    “Writing in the Disciplines: Citation Analysis of Theatre and Performance Studies Journals”
    </b>

<li> Research Topic </li>
  </b>
  <p>
First emerging in the 1980s,
Performance Studies is a relatively new discipline which is, in fact,
interdisciplinary or (some would say) post-disciplinary.
Because Performance Studies scholars come from varied academic
fields and draw from approaches in Theatre, Cultural Studies, Anthropology, History,
and Literary Criticism it is difficult to identify consistent writing
conventions within the field. This poses a challenge for educators who wish to
familiarize their students with genre and design strategies, for academics
seeking publication, and for journals that wish to engender a fair and productive
peer-review process.
</p>
<p>
It is not the intention or desire of the primary researchers to standardize or
codify a “right” or “wrong” way to write within the discipline of Performance Studies,
rather it is our hope to identify existing trends in published writing across the
field in order to identify lacunae or anomalies in our writing and publishing
practices and start critical conversations amongst stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
For the purposes of this project, we are most interested in the quantity,
frequency, and overlap of works cited in scholarly journal articles across the
discipline. While citation analysis can offer a misleading or shallow metric for
measuring the worth or quality of a scholarly article we chose citations as a
topic because, an overview of works cited has the widest-reaching potential to
reveal dominant theoretical strains, over or under emphasis on certain subjects or
time periods, absent voices, oversights, redundancies, and biases within our
scholarship. We are not attempting to measure the scholarly worth or value of a
specific article or set of articles but rather to spot potential patterns.

    </li>
<p>
The primary researchers on this project are two doctoral candidates in
Performance Studies, Victoria Scrimer and Kelley Holley. Victoria and Kelley will
be the primary parties responsible for selecting and collecting source material, organizing and
cleaning up data, analyzing and presenting data. We also recognize, however,
the need to consult with and include at least one other team member who can assist
with coding in the text analysis process, so we have also engaged the assistance of Ed Summers,
 developer and digital archivist at MITH. Ed has helped us identify, install, and customize citation parsing tools.

  Research Question(s)
  </b>
  </li>

<ul>
<li>	On average, how many works are cited in a single, published article? What is the ratio of books to articles?</li>

<li> What are the most frequently cited books over the last ten years of performance studies scholarship? When were they published? </li>

<li> What are the most frequently cited articles or essays over the last ten years of performance studies scholarship? When were they published?</li>

<li> What are the most frequently cited performances or plays over the last ten years of performance studies scholarship?</li>
</ul>

<b>
Subject of Study
</b>
</li>
<p>
  For our subject of study, we have identified four of the top journals in the field of Performance
  Studies each of which represents a different professional organization and approach to the discipline.
  To go about choosing these journals we first organized several well-known journals in a spreadsheet
  where we could identify and compare their publisher, professional associations, and primary subject
   matter.  This spreadsheet along with our notes can be
   viewed
   <a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13HQO4bTpzuERDlkNlMoG5Gbk83chUULCletEXueFLTI/edit?usp=sharing">
     here</a>
     <p>We then selected Theatre Survey, Theatre Journal, TDR and PAJ  as our initial subjects of study because all four journals claim to discuss both theatre and performance, the former are both peer-reviewed and from associations, the latter are both not peer reviewed and have had individual long standing editors. Based on each of their impact rating (recorded in the spreadsheet), they're also significant journals in the field. With these four we are able to make fair comparisons in their respective categories and against the other.</p>
     <p>
     We have chosen to focus only on featured articles in each of the four publications,
     excluding book reviews, editorial notes, or issue introductions in order to mitigate
     potential publication-based biases and text that might skew the data.
     </p>

<p>
Because we are approaching the end of the second decade of the 21st century it seemed
timely to frame this project as a ten-year retrospective on Performance Studies
scholarship. This is both an appealing framework for possible publications as well
as a statistically significant span of time from which to draw conclusions.

Methodology
</b>
</li>
<p>
  Distant reading, or the collection and analysis of large quantities of text, has traditionally been used to analyze literary texts, but could easily be used to model the genre conventions of academic writing.

  In order to engage in distant reading of Performance Studies scholarship, we will need to perform a text analysis of a large corpus of scholarly articles. For the purposes of this project we are specifically interested in citation extraction and parsing along with the bibliometric analysis of those results.

  In order to perform a text analysis we will need to collect and collate machine readable text of the research subject from each issue of each journal dating back ten years.

  Based on the results of the text analysis we will design a comparative data visualization to help share and explain our findings.

<p>  It was much more difficult than expected to identify tools for extracting
  citations from a large corpus of variably formatted text. After consultation
  with experts at MITH and conversations with other scholars involved in library science and
  digital archives, we eventually landed on AnyStyle, a parser designed to find and parse academic
  references.

  The source code for AnyStyle is hosted on GitHub where you can access
  the <a href="http://github.com/inukshuk/anystyle.git">latest code</a>. </p>

  <p>There was a web interface for AnyStyle but the designers have the page down for
    indefinite maintenance. Conveniently, you can also use AnyStyle in Ruby
    (a general-purpose scripting language). After installing the anystyle gem,
     we were able to run AnyStyle.parse and AnyStyle.find through the command line.
     AnyStyle.parse will parse a single line of text into author (family and given name),
     date, title, edition, location, publisher, language, scripts, type. AnyStyle.find will find
     citations in a PDF and parse those as well. This data will appear in the terminal window but
     can easily be moved to a JSON file stored in any desired location.
     </p>

<p>  We first tried combining all articles from a single issue of a journal into a large PDF then
  running the AnyStyle.find command. We found that AnyStyle had difficulty finding and extracting
  citations within a very large corpus so we attempted to run the command on one PDF at a time.
  This yielded much more accurate results, but it was prohibitively time consuming considering we
   wanted to parse hundreds of citations and export that data into several large CSV files.

  Ed Summers at MITH, therefore, helped to create a custom parser using the AnyStyle Ruby library.
   The code for this is also hosted on
  <a href="https://github.com/edsu/citation-playground">GitHub </a>.
  This allowed us to perform citation extraction and parsing on a corpus of articles by dropping
  the PDFs in a directory and then running a program to pull the citation data out of all articles
  in the directory rather than performing the function on one PDF at a time. Ed also designed a
  conversion function to convert all JSON files in the directory to CSV.
