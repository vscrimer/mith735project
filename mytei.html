  <p>Because algorithmic parsing utilities like AnyStyle struggle to accurately locate and parse citations
    that are included in discursive foot/end notes which happens to be the primary mode of listing citations
    in these journals, one possible iteration of this project could be building
    a public database of reference notes. This could be a crowd sourced
    project in which we make available an online library of .txt files containing only the bibliographic
    notes from a single issue of a particular journal. Users could then encode those files using a shared
    markup scheme like TEI. The files could then be parsed or searched to generate data for modeling.</p>

    <p>For example: text that appears like this:</p>

See my article "Scorning the Image of Virtue: The Player Nathan Field's Letter to the Reverend Thomas Sutton, 1616," Religion and the Arts 20.3 (2016): 267≠89, at 272 n. 5. Knapp underscores the relative scholarly neglect by pointing to a longstanding secularization theory that depicts Shakespeare's theatre as self-separated from religious concern. He shows that men like Jonson and Shakespeare had deep religious convictions, and how these convictions were bound up in their lives and in the plays they wrote. Whereas Knapp stays anecdotally grounded, synthesizing a trove of archival research to make his case, Michael O'Connell draws on theological currents in Reformation thought --those concerned with religion and performance. In The Idolatrous Eye: Iconoclasm & Theater in Early-Modern England (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000), O'Connell associates English iconoclasm with the period's antitheatrical prejudice and argues that the theatre's "incarnational" mode of expression was deeply problematic for the church (63≠88).

The missive responds to a sermon that Thomas Sutton wielded from the pulpit in direct attack on Field and his profession. Field's letter is a rare instance in the record of an actor defending the theatre. He portrays a deft use of biblical parable and political prowess to indict Sutton as both a spiritual poison and


enemy of the state. The original manuscript is found in the State Papers Domestic of James I, lxxxix, 105, Public Records Office, London. See my detailed treatment of the letter in "Scorning the Image of Virtue: Church and Theatre in Post-Settlement England" (Ph.D. diss., Graduate Theological Union, 2015). 23.

Bulwer was also a Baconian natural philosopher, and he proposed the first manuals and curriculum for instructing the deaf. 26. Strong further develops and broadens his analysis of English portraiture in The Cult of Elizabeth: Elizabethan Portraiture and Pageantry (London: Thames & Hudson, 1977), 56. 27. See a detailed identification of this portrait in Charles Knowles Bolton, The Founders: Portraits of Persons Born Abroad Who Came to the Colonies in North America before the Year 1701. . . [1919], 3 vols. in 2 (Baltimore: Genealogical Pub. Co., 1976), 3: 1004≠15. 28. Cohen, 21. 29. According to Janice Knight, "It was only with the Word as delivered by Richard Sibbes that Cotton's affections were turned. The sermon that so affected him was a meditation on regeneration, in which Sibbes rejected `negative righteousness' or `mere civil, sober, honest blamelessness before men' as an indication of grace received. Nor would Sibbes allow for the violent hammering of the heart as a preparation for grace. Instead Sibbes' sermons stressed God's turning of the heart as witnessed by lively affections, a new relish and taste for divine things. . . . His words filled Cotton `with a sacred joy, which accompanied him unto the fulness of joy for ever.' This was the doctrine Cotton had long awaited, the one that drew him from the study to the pulpit. . . . Legend has it that his heart was so immediately transformed by Sibbes' gospel that on the next occasion of his own preaching, Cotton abandoned his former ornate rhetoric and spoke in the simple and affecting words of the puritan plainstyle, advertising to all the world his conversion." See Knight, "A Garden Enclosed: The Tradition of Heart-piety in Puritan New England" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1988), 90≠1. 30. Cohen, 21.

In the popular mind, Twelfth Night's Malvolio may be Shakespeare's quintessential puritanical hypocrite. 36. This oft-used quotation is from Philip Sidney's The Defence of Poesy (ca. 1579; published 1595), repr. as "An Apology for Poetry (1595)," in Shakespeare's Theater, ed. Pollard, 146≠65, at 153. 37.

I provide literary and historical analysis of a letter from Field to Sutton, one that is addressed here only briefly. The letter attests to Field's religious commitments in the face of religious hypocrisy and the antitheatrical attack, and he extends his concerns on behalf of himself as well as his fellow players. Field's portrait read intertextually with his letter brings the religious iconography of the image into greater relief.</p>
