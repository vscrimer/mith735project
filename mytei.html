  <p><b><font color="orange">How could TEI be helpful?</font></b></p>
  <p>Because algorithmic parsing utilities like AnyStyle struggle to accurately locate and parse citations
    that are included in discursive foot/end notes which happens to be the primary mode of listing citations
    in our subject journals, one possible iteration of this project could be building
    a public database or conglomorate bibliography for performance studies journals which could then be
    encoded for easier parsing. Gregory Palermo et al. have recieved a Startup grant from
  the NEH Digital Humanities Advancement program to create just such a
  <a href="https://palermog.github.io/blog/2017/09/Biblio-Fall17-Welcome.html">
     centralized bibliography
     </a> for the
    digital humanities journal, DHQ. Their project is basically an XML database of bibliographic entires from all DHQ
    articles which is then encoded in a customized TEI markup.

  <p> Instead of using AnyStyle to parse compiled bibliographic entires and then clean up the data,
    we could create a similar XML database of TEI encoded performance studies bibliographies.
    Perhaps, this could be a crowd sourced
    project in which we make available an online library of .txt files containing only the bibliographic
    notes from a single issue of a particular journal. Users could then encode those files using a shared
    markup scheme like TEI. The files could then be parsed or searched to generate data for modeling.

  Below is a set of citations AnyStyle had difficulty parsing marked up in TEI following Palermo's example.
